# ReadMe-Generator
I have created a command line prompt which uses javascript and implementation of Node.js and mysql database to create a employee database for the business owner. This prompt will ask the owner various questions about the employee and will be able to push it to a data base. This will make it easier for the owner to always refer to employee data.
